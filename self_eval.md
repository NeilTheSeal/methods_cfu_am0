# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of the method I wrote for exercise #5 in final_practice.rb. It creates the correct output using only 10 lines of code and only requires 1 `if` statement. At first, I thought that I would have to use a bunch of if/else statements for every possible scenario but then I realized I could use string interpolation and two variables to get the desired outcome. I also learned that variables declared within an `if` statement can be accessed from outside the `if` statement. This is not the case in JavaScript, and I think it will come in very handy.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods can be used to do just about anything. If you have inputs and want to do something different based on what the input is, you would use a method. For example, if I am writing a game like Super Mario, I would want to have Mario jump when I press the up key, and to move forward when I press the right key. The possibilities are endless.
